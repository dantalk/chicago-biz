# Command-line data wrangling fun: Chicago Business License Data

This walkthrough/stream is best meant for data people who know pretty well how to use spreadsheets, SQL, Python/pandas/Jupyter/R/tidyverse for data wrangling, and are wondering: why the #@%&? anyone would ever do work from the seemingly ass-backwards Unix-like command-line.

I'll be using a real-world dataset – the city of Chicago business license database – so there may be some data journalism musings too.
